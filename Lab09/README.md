I Implemented FieldAI...() Functions for Extra Credit.

Summary:
I feel like this lab really highlighted main concepts of other labs, hashing/encryption, Checksums/Message Protocols. What I mean by other lab is for example, I had
to use tokens, matrices, pointers/nodes, and etc. which I find very nice for the last lab of the quarter. The lab manual was very useful in telling me what each files does.
Using the ..._correct.o files really help me find out what needs to be implemented in the other files we had to create.

Approach:
First, I started this lab by playing around with the correct.o files and uploading it onto my lab kit and fiddled around with it. I didn't really get that far with it
since I didn't have a partner for the lab. However, I took notes of each file and made sure I really understand what I needed to implement. I started with Negotiation.c since
it was the easiest to write. Then Agent.c, Field.c, and Message.c. How I would approach this lab differently is by finding a friend in the class because this lab took too much
of my time. However, I noticed that doing it solo could double the points for implementing most of the files so I chose to do that instead. What I found very unhelpful 
was the Battlebots.py and Agents.py because I didn't really know how to run it. I did try asking for help in discord, but no one really knewhow.

Result:
The result of this lab went pretty well considering that I'll be recieving double points for most of the completed files. The only file I wasn't going to implement was fieldTest.c.
Since, I don't really like to do unit testing and fieldTest.c seemed like it required alot of time to implement. On this lab, I spent about 5-6 days grinding it. One time, I 
accidentally kicked my power surge protector that was hooked up to my PC. This incident had set me back about 2-3 hours of implementation that I couldn't get back. However, It
took me 1-2 hours writing the code from my head and notes. I wouldn't changed much about this lab except for explanation for the python scripts in the lab manual.
