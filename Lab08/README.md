Summary:

The highlight of this lab is learning about the concept of File I/O. The reason why I feel that way is beause we are accessing a folder with over +50 text documents
inside of it. This lab required us to implement a Dungeon Themed Game, where the player can navigate through the world by going North, East, South, or West. The lab manual
usually tells us the output or pseudocode of the main function. However, this lab was up to us to figure it out.

Approach:

My approach to this lab was to learn what fgetc(), fread(), and fseek(). These function are a very new concept to me and it was worth learning about it, since it got me through
the lab. The main issues I had in this lab was when I was pick a direction, the player moves over by two. Which means it was skipping a room each time it went. After debugging 
for about 3 hours, I was able to find the issue.

Result:

This lab took me around 4-5 days long. This was one of the hardest labs so far, since the lab manual wasn't holding my hand throughout the lab. However, I was able to finsih
it before the deadline. What I had liked about this lab was that it was very open ended, meaning that we can code it however we wanted to. For example, I used a helper function
openFile() to store data into variables and helped making my other functions more easier to write. What I disliked about the lab was the complexity of it and how it didn't involved
the lab kit at all. When I first saw this lab, I was wondering if we were going to turn our lab kits into a gameboy or something similiar. However, I'm quite disappoint when I found
out it didn't.
