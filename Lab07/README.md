Summary: This lab had required use to implement a simulated toaster oven into our PIC32 lab kits. To do so we had to code the buttons, analog wheel(ADC),
and the Oled display functionality. We also learned how to use macros and set constants using uint8_t and uint16_t, which are unsigned 1 or 2 bytes variables.
One of the most important aspect of this lab was transcibing the FSM diagram into code. The reason why I believed that it was the most important part of this lab
was because we had to make sure what mode or state the "toaster oven" was in.

Approach: My approach to this lab was to read up on the lab7 pdf and saw the flow chart. After analyzing the flow chart, I wrote it down on a piece of paper with
more details on what should happen and come up with constants and variables I will need to use. After having a better understanding of the diagram, I began following
the steps in the lab from part 1 all the way to part 14. During the whole process I did have issues with changing the temperature in bake mode and having the timer countdown.
What I had realize is that I messed up in the prints statements where I had the oven on, but had the timer set to the initial cook time instead of the time left.
I wouldn't have approached this lab very differently since writing out how the flow chart works really helped me get a grasp on the implementation. However, I should've started
the assignment earlier since I have barely made the due date, but I had been studying for my midterms for my other classes.

Result: The result of this lab created a simulated toaster oven, that has the ability to Bake, Broil, and Toast. On this lab I have spent roughly 2-3 days and had to do some
all-nighters writing out the code. However, I did take breaks by going to the gym and watching youtube videos after every 4-6 hours. What I had disliked in the Lab was that
some of the instructions in the lab was kinda vague and not really sure if I should use uint8_t or uint16_t for some of my variables. However everything worked out in the end.
This lab has made me feel really proud of the end result. After seeing my creation, I feel like this lab has made me more prepared for future classes and careers.
