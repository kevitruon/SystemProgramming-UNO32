Summary:

This lab required us to use arrays and hardcode test harness to help us find where our code run into problems with its outputs.
I think the most important aspect of this lab was learning how to use arrays and have a better understanding of functions returning values.

Approach:

This lab was fairly easy to do, the only thing that really took brainpower was determining how much spaces to put between the numbers in the function MatrixPrint().
How I approached this lab was by coding every function first before testing for my mistakes. This had saved me alot of time from testing after defining each function.
This lab hasn't really thought me that much because CSE30(Programming Abstraction: Python) had taught us how to use arrays by coding a sudoku solver.

Feedback:

I feel like this lab was easier than Lab2, however I think it is a great lab for those who haven't worked with arrays before. I also feel like the point distribution was
placed in fairly and I appreaciate the free 1 point! Thank You!
