What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes?  Why?

This code statement will basically pause the program and requires the user to press enter before continuing. It does this because scanf() requires a user 
input to continue to the next line. However, ever the user inputted wouldn't be saved because we didn't specify where to store the input.



In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside
of certain functions.  Explain why a rule like this is useful.

I found this rule useful because it makes our function return one value. 
Another example, is when we want to call the function, but only want the value of the math, but don't want the program to print a statement


How long did this lab take you?  Was it harder or easier than you
expected?

This lab only took me around 6 hours long. This lab was just as I had expected and wasn't so bad since we're making a simple calculator. 
However, I did have trouble with my else statement running even though my if statement accepted it, so I changed my else statements to else ifs.
