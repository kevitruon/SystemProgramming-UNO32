What did you do in the lab?

For Part0, I learned how to how to use operate MPLAB X IDE and found out how to view my print codes.
For Part0.1, I learned how to use Ubuntu and use it to open *.c files with the Linux Powershell.
For Part1, I learned how to debug and learned how to view the values of variables in each line of my code using breaklines
also learned how to format my code to a coding style!!!
For Part2, I learned how to format strings and floats and used it to make a table that converts C째 to F째 and K째 to F째
Part3, I was unable to work on it, since I do not have the lab kit on hand, however I'll be able to pick it up on Monday(1/10)

What mistakes did you make, and how did you identify and solve them?

Most of my mistakes in the beginning because I didn't install 'gcc' or 'make' and I didn't realise until hours of frustration on why my code 
wouldn't build. Another issue was mostly in the project properties because you have to turn on each setting after you make a new project.

Do you have any feedback for us about this lab?

I don't really have any feedback on improving the lab, however I thought the lab was good because it taught me how to find issues in my code
and how to address it with efficiency. Overall, this was a good lab that teaches how to use MPLAB X IDE!!!!
