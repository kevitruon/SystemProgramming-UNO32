Summary: 
	This lab highlighted the concepts of stacks, tokens, structs, string manipulation, and error handling. I found the most important concept
of this lab was working with stacks. I have taken CSE12: Assembly Languange and we had to learn about stacks, but didn't completely understand it.
It was until I started this lab that I watched a youtube video for the introductory of stacks, FILO, LIFO. To make it easier to code, I also learned 
how to use the switch/case/default statements to handle the outcomes of errors.

Approach:
	My general approach of this lab was reading out the main concepts and watch introductory youtube video on each of them. This had made me 
learn the concept and learned the logic behind it. Something that went wrong after I finish writing the code and first testing was my StackPop() function because
I accidentally copied the first value in the stack into both operand variables which had cause lots of confusion for me when testing. How I would approach this lab again
would be to stop procrastinating the lab until the last two days because it took me all Saturday/Sunday to code and test it, unlike the other labs where I could do them
in just a few hours. Another thing was helpful was when I was building the project, but the rpn_test and stack_test both had a main(). So, I went on discord and saw that I
had to exclude them from the project build, which helped be find errors in my Lab4_main.c, rpn.c, and stack.c.

Result:
	This lab took me around two days to code/unit test. It was very stressful because I was sitting on my computer for 10 hours straight in 3 sittings figuring out how to
implement the code. Finally, I had finish everything with lots of hours to spare until the deadline. This lab was worthwhile because it made me learn alot of different concepts.
What I liked about the lab was the token function because it opened a new perspective on how to implement the code and I like it's unique quirks. The hardest part of this lab was
the rpn_evaluate() function because it took alot of my time on figuring out how to prevent user error by iterating through each token in the rpn_sentence. The lab grade distribution 
seems fair and it was hard, however it is worth 19 points which is very reasonable.
